            <p>The purpose of this prompt was to practice collaboration using <a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/ide/online/">CS50 IDE</a> and <a href="github.com">Github</a> to  practice linking to markdown files.</p>
            
            <p>My partner (Chanry) and I created an adventure about "Life As A Baby" through <a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/ide/online/">CS50 IDE</a> and <a href="github.com">Github</a>. We worked as a team to achieve our prompt, we each worked on a certain section and we kept in touch through <a href="slack.com">slack</a> to meet the conditions given by my teacher (Mr. Mueller).</p>
            
            <p>I think that the biggest challenge we faced during this project was creating the storyline. At first, we were excited to begin the project, however when we were prompted to start writing the storyline, we were stumped, so we imagined ourselves as babies (What would I do if I were a baby???/How would I behave???). It took us many diagrams (plans), before we created a diagram (plan) we were happy with. From there we went on to bringing everything together. Throughout, this project I worked on many skills, including collaboration and communication. For us to make this project come to life, we needed to communicate with each other our ideas. When we communicated, we also collaborated using <a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/ide/online/">CS50 IDE</a> and <a href="github.com">Github.</a> I feel like I learned a lot and I had fun making this project with my partner (Chanry). Next time, I hope to create a more longer storyline.</p>
