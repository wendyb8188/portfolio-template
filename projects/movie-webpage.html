            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>My goal was to make a webpage with my partner (Wilson) through <a href="Replit.it">Replit</a> using my knowledge of basic HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that I learned recently in Mr. Mueller's SEP class. </p><br>
          
            <p>My partner and I, decided to make our webpage using the genres of comedy and action, so we created a Movie-Webpage about two fictional characters (Jill/Jack) who have a love-hate neighbor relationship with one another.
            We worked together to accomplish our goal, each of us worked on different parts of the coding, we kept in contact throughout the entire project to ensure we had reached all the requirements necessary for a 100.</p><br>
          
            <p>I think that a challenge we faced was figuring out what we were gonna base our entire webpage about, it took us quite some time to come up with our characters and our plot. Another challenge we faced was figuring out how to get certain pictures/texts
                where we envisioned them. Through this project I learned the importance of COMMUNICATION, in order for the movie webpage to be made, I need to communicate with my partner. I also learned to think with a growth mindset, without this
               I would have had trouble deciphering the problems in my code, since I reached out to my partner and listened to what he had to say, I was able to preservere through the challenges I came across. Through this project, I learned several new information and 
                I put to work multiple skills incuding communication and having a growth mindset. I am glad I had the oppurtunity to be a part of this project and I'm looking forward to more projects in which I not only learn more about coding, but learn about valuable life lessons.</p>
