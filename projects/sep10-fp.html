            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about Art. The purpose of this blog is to inform people about how art is impacted by technology.</p>
            
            <p>For this project, I made a website about Art using HTML, CSS, and <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Art and making the website..</p>
            
            <p>Throughout this project I experienced many different things. There were times when I had fun, but there were also times when I had moments where I felt frustrated. Here are some of the challenges I faced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Debugging the problem: Finding the mistake to a problem was a challenge I ran into several times. Whether it is in code or without, problems are inevitable.</li>
                <li>Learning on my Own: Learning new things is challenging, but it becomes even challenging when you don’t have any support. I experienced this through learning how to solve things before asking for help.</li>
                <li>Time Management: Another challenge is keeping things organized in order to prevent stress.</li>
                <li>Progress: I found it challenging not getting ahead of myself, especially when I was done early. </li>
                <li>Group Work: Throughout the course of learning topics like HTML, CSS, and github, I was given tasks to do collaboratively. However, there were times where my teammates didn’t do their parts, making it difficult on my part along with the other students in the group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In consequence of challenges like these, I’ve learned from my experiences. Below are a some of the takeaways I’ve received:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspect Tool/Command + F: These are your best-friends for finding both the problem and the solution to your obstacle (specifically in code).</li>
                <li>Questions: Ask questions, the more you ask the more you learn!</li>
                <li>Schedules: It’s important to balance out your work in order to finish in time.</li>
                <li>MVP: Aim for the “Minimal Viable Product” before making things pretty. Keep things simple, don’t over complicate your life! </li>
                <li>Skills: Throughout the entire process, I developed skills including: collaboration, communication, problem decomposition, Debugging, How to learn, How to Google, How to read, Time management, Embracing failure, Organization, Consideration, </li>
            </ul>
            <p>My next steps are to continue informing people about ways art and technology can be intertwined, but not just with art. I want to encourage people to research on their own, ways technology can also be intertwined with things they are passionate about! Speaking of this, I encourage YOU to do the same!</p>
